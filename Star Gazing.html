            <pre style="font-size: 16px;">
                Astronomy can be daunting for beginners — after all there’s a whole universe out there! 
                But stargazing basics don’t have to be hard. Sky & Telescope editors (with more than 100 
                years of collective experience) are here to help you learn your way around the night sky. 
                Whether you’re looking for your first telescope, trying to learn the constellations, or want 
                to learn to use star charts, you’ve come to the right place. The best way to start exploring 
                the night sky is with the unaided eye. Our star wheels are easy to use, and in no time 
                you’ll learn the constellations and names of the stars. And that’s only the beginning!

                star, any massive self-luminous celestial body of gas that shines by radiation 
                derived from its internal energy sources. Of the tens of billions of trillions 
                of stars composing the observable universe, only a very small percentage are 
                visible to the naked eye. Many stars occur in pairs, multiple systems, or star 
                clusters. The members of such stellar groups are physically related through 
                common origin and are bound by mutual gravitational attraction. Somewhat related
                to star clusters are stellar associations, which consist of loose groups of 
                physically similar stars that have insufficient mass as a group to remain together
                as an organization.
                
                This article describes the properties and evolution of individual stars.Included 
                in the discussion are the sizes, energetics, temperatures, masses, and chemical 
                compositions of stars, as well as their distances and motions. The myriad other 
                stars are compared with the Sun, strongly implying that “our” star is in no way 
                special.</p>

             <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px;">Stars formation and evolution</h2>
             <pre style="font-size: 16px;"> <p>
                Throughout the Milky Way Galaxy (and even near the Sun itself), astronomers have 
                discovered stars that are well evolved or even approaching extinction, or both, 
                as well as occasional stars that must be very young or still in the process of 
                formation. Evolutionary effects on these stars are not negligible, even for a 
                middle-aged star such as the Sun. More massive stars must display more spectacular 
                effects because the rate of conversion of mass into energy is higher. While the 
                Sun produces energy at the rate of about two ergs per gram per second, a more 
                luminous main-sequence star can release energy at a rate some 1,000 times greater.
                Consequently, effects that require billions of years to be easily recognized in 
                the Sun might occur within a few million years in highly luminous and massive 
                stars. A supergiant star such as Antares, a bright main-sequence star such as 
                Rigel, or even a more modest star such as Sirius cannot have endured as long as 
                the Sun has endured. These stars must have been formed relatively recently.</p>

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Birth of stars and evolution to the main sequence</h2> <p>
                Detailed radio maps of nearby molecular clouds reveal that they are clumpy, with 
                regions containing a wide range of densities—from a few tens of molecules (mostly
                hydrogen) per cubic centimetre to more than one million. Stars form only from the 
                densest regions, termed cloud cores, though they need not lie at the geometric 
                centre of the cloud. Large cores (which probably contain subcondensations) up to 
                a few light-years in size seem to give rise to unbound associations of very massive 
                stars (called OB associations after the spectral type of their most prominent members,
                O and B stars) or to bound clusters of less massive stars. Whether a stellar group
                materializes as an association or a cluster seems to depend on the efficiency of 
                star formation. If only a small fraction of the matter goes into making stars, 
                the rest being blown away in winds or expanding H II regions, then the remaining 
                stars end up in a gravitationally unbound association, dispersed in a single crossing
                time (diameter divided by velocity) by the random motions of the formed stars. 
                On the other hand, if 30 percent or more of the mass of the cloud core goes into 
                making stars, then the formed stars will remain bound to one another, and the ejection
                of stars by random gravitational encounters between cluster members will take many
                crossing times.</p>

                              <img src="Centre.webp" height="400px"><p><br>
                Low-mass stars also are formed in associations called T associations after the prototypical
                stars found in such groups, T Tauri stars. The stars of a T association form from loose
                aggregates of small molecular cloud cores a few tenths of a light-year in size that 
                are randomly distributed through a larger region of lower average density. The formation
                of stars in associations is the most common outcome; bound clusters account for only
                about 1 to 10 percent of all star births. The overall efficiency of star formation 
                in associations is quite small. Typically less than 1 percent of the mass of a molecular
                cloud becomes stars in one crossing time of the molecular cloud (about 5 106 years). 
                Low efficiency of star formation presumably explains why any interstellar gas remains 
                in the Galaxy after 1010 years of evolution. Star formation at the present time must be
                a mere trickle of the torrent that occurred when the Galaxy was young.</p>

                star, Any massive celestial body of gas that shines by radiant energy generated inside 
                it. The Milky Way Galaxy contains hundreds of billions of stars; only a very small 
                fraction are visible to the unaided eye. The closest star to Earth is the Sun. The 
                closest star to the Sun is about 4.2 light-years away; the most distant are in galaxies
                billions of light-years away. Single stars such as the Sun are the minority; most 
                stars occur in pairs and multiple systems (see binary star). Stars also associate by
                their mutual gravity in larger assemblages called clusters (see globular cluster; 
                open cluster). Constellations consist not of such groupings but of stars in the 
                same direction as seen from Earth. Stars vary greatly in brightness (magnitude), 
                colour, temperature, mass, size, chemical composition, and age. In nearly all, hydrogen
                is the most abundant element. Stars are classified by their spectra (see spectrum),
                from blue-white to red, as O, B, A, F, G, K, or M; the Sun is a spectral type G star.
                Generalizations on the nature and evolution of stars can be made from correlations between
                certain properties and from statistical results (see Hertzsprung-Russell diagram).
                A star forms when a portion of a dense interstellar cloud of hydrogen and dust grains
                collapses from its own gravity. As the cloud condenses, its density and internal 
                temperature increase until it is hot enough to trigger nuclear fusion in its core 
                (if not, it becomes a brown dwarf). After hydrogen is exhausted in the core from nuclear
                burning, the core shrinks and heats up while the star’s outer layers expand significantly
                and cool, and the star becomes a red giant. The final stages of a star’s evolution, 
                when it no longer produces enough energy to counteract its own gravity, depend 
                largely on its mass and whether it is a component of a close binary system (see black
                hole; neutron star; nova; pulsar; supernova; white dwarf star). Some stars other than 
                the Sun are known to have one or more planets (see extrasolar planet). See also

             <pre style="font-size: 16px;"><p>
                universe, the whole cosmic system of matter and energy of which Earth, and therefore
                the human race, is a part. Humanity has traveled a long road since societies imagined
                Earth, the Sun, and the Moon as the main objects of creation, with the rest of the
                universe being formed almost as an afterthought. Today it is known that Earth is only
                a small ball of rock in a space of unimaginable vastness and that the birth of the 
                solar system was probably only one event among many that occurred against the backdrop
                of an already mature universe. This humbling lesson has unveiled a remarkable fact,
                one that endows the minutest particle in the universe with a rich and noble heritage:
                events that occurred in the first few minutes of the creation of the universe 13.7 
                billion years ago turn out to have had a profound influence on the birth, life, and
                death of galaxies, stars, and planets. Indeed, a line can be drawn from the forging of
                the matter of the universe in a primal “big bang” to the gathering on Earth of atoms
                versatile enough to serve as the basis of life. The intrinsic harmony of such a worldview
                has great philosophical and aesthetic appeal, and it may explain why public interest 
                in the universe has always endured.</p>

             <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px;">Earliest conceptions of the universe</h2>
             <pre style="font-size: 16px;"><p>
                All scientific thinking on the nature of the universe can be traced to the distinctive
                geometric patterns formed by the stars in the night sky. Even prehistoric people must
                have noticed that, apart from a daily rotation (which is now understood to arise from
                the spin of Earth), the stars did not seem to move with respect to one another: the 
                stars appear “fixed.” Early nomads found that knowledge of the constellations could 
                guide their travels, and they developed stories to help them remember the relative 
                positions of the stars in the night sky. These stories became the mythical tales that
                are part of most cultures.

                When nomads turned to farming, an intimate knowledge of the constellations served a 
                new function—an aid in timekeeping, in particular for keeping track of the seasons. 
                People had noticed very early that certain celestial objects did not remain stationary
                relative to the “fixed” stars; instead, during the course of a year, they moved 
                forward and backward in a narrow strip of the sky that contained 12 constellations 
                constituting the signs of the zodiac. Seven such wanderers were known to the ancients:
                the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Foremost among the 
                wanderers was the Sun: day and night came with its rising and setting, and its motion 
                through the zodiac signaled the season to plant and the season to reap. Next in 
                importance was the Moon: its position correlated with the tides, and its shape changed
                intriguingly over the course of a month. The Sun and Moon had the power of gods; 
                why not then the other wanderers? Thus probably arose the astrological belief that the
                positions of the planets (from the Greek word planetes, “wanderers”) in the zodiac 
                could influence worldly events and even cause the rise and fall of kings. In homage to 
                this belief, Babylonian priests devised the week of seven days, whose names even in 
                various modern languages (for example, English, French, or Norwegian) can still easily 
                be traced to their origins in the seven planet-gods.</p><br>
