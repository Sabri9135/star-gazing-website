            <pre style="background-color: rgb(22, 22, 61); color: white; font-size: 18px;">
                The most popular tourist attraction in Ladakh, Pangong lake is an 
                endorheic (landlocked) lake situated at 4350 meters. Also known as Pangong Tso 
                it is 12 kilometres long and extends from India to Tibet. Almost 60% of 
                Pangong Lake lies in the Tibetan Autonomous Region. A unique feature of 
                the lake is that it does not remain blue throughout the year or even the day, 
                rather it changes colours from azure to light blue to green and grey too! It is 
                famous amongst tourists as Ladakh lake, the spot where the Bollywood 
                movie "3 Idiots" was shot.

                Since the enthralling Pangong Lake falls on the Sino-Indian Actual Line of 
                Control, an inner line permit is required to visit it. The Indian Nationals can 
                easily obtain individual permits while other foreign nationals need to obtain a 
                group permit, with at least 3 persons in the group, accompanied by an 
                accredited guide. The permit can be obtained at the tourist office in Leh, for 
                a small fee. Owing to its altitude, the Pangong Lake temperature ranges from 
                -5°C to 10°C as a result of which it freezes completely during winters in 
                spite of its salinity.

                <b>Nubra Valley J&K</b>
                <pre style="background-color: rgb(22, 22, 61); color: white; font-size: 18px;">
                Nubra Valley lies in the union territory of Ladakh at a distance of around 140 Km 
                from Leh. Located on the ancient Silk Route, the valley has Shyok and Nubra rivers 
                snaking through it and some beautiful monasteries.
                
                With arid mountains in the backdrop, Hundar in Nubra Valley is famous for the 
                Bactrian camel rides. Bactrian camels are of the rarest sort, having two 
                humps and were the primary source of transportation in the silk route. Diskit 
                Monastery in Nubra Valley is known for the 32 metre Maitreya Buddha statue 
                located near the monastery. There are a lot of activities like ATV rides and 
                ziplining in the Nubra Valley.

                The region is currently under military supervision because the road further 
                leads to the Siachen base camp, which happens to be the highest battlefield 
                in the world. Most tourists travel to Nubra Valley from Leh through Khardung La.

            <li><b>Rann Of Kutch</b></li>
            <pre style="background-color: rgb(22, 22, 61); color: white; font-size: 18px;">

                the District of Kutch, in the western state of India, Gujarat. The vast expanse 
                is situated in the Thar Desert and is formed of salt marshes. Sunsets at 
                the Great Rann of Kutch are a treat to the eyes after exploring the region.
                 
                The region is divided into two parts, the Great Rann of Kutch and Little Rann 
                of Kutch and comprises of massive deposits of salt in the desert. These 
                deposits are known for producing a mirage, and many pilgrims have shared 
                stories about witnessing optical illusion that seem as good as real.
                  
                The region has been so famous for its natural beauty that it was featured in 
                numerous films in India, for example - Refugee, Magadheera, Goliyon Ki Raasleela 
                Ram Leela, Sarainodu etc. It has also been mentioned in several 
                books including the Booker Prize-Winning Novel, Midnight's Children, written 
                by Salman Rushdie. The name, Great Rann of Kutch, was derived from 
                the word "Rann" meaning desert in Hindi and the district it is located in. It is 
                considered as one of the largest salt deserts in the entire world.

            <li><b>Neil Island,Andaman & Nicobar</b></li>
            <pre style="background-color: rgb(22, 22, 61); color: white; font-size: 18px;">
                Neill Island is a part of the South Andaman Administrative District and belongs to Ritchie’s 
                Archipelago in the Bay of Bengal. A part of the massive ocean separates it from Ross Island 
                and Havelock Island, Tourists visiting Havelock often make a day-long trip to Neill Island.
                
                Perhaps the most endearing feature of this island is its three sandy beaches, namely 
                Bharatpur Beach, Sitapur Beach and Lakshmanpur Beach. The forest cover has reduced 
                considerably due to the cultivation of rice but a section in the north-west of the island is 
                being preserved actively.

                The regions where the forest cover is lost has a couple of degrees or so higher temperature 
                than the region with enough flora. Nonetheless, Neill Island is the major supplier of 
                vegetables to most regions of the Andaman Islands.
                Due to its limited area, Neill Island can be covered with a simple walk. All three beaches are 
                exquisite and extraordinarily clean and are well-connected to the mainland as well.
